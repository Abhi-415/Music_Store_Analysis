## Key Analyses:
1. Top Customer Identification:
  - Determined the customer who spent the most money across the platform.
  - Identified top spenders in various countries.
2. Popular Music Genres:

- For countries with shared maximum purchases, all relevant genres were considered.
3. Invoice Insights:
  - Determined the countries with the highest number of invoices.
- Identified the city with the highest sum of invoice totals, helping to plan a promotional music festival.
4. Customer & Artist Relationships:
  - Tracked how much each customer spent on specific artists.
- Identified the best customers for targeted promotions.
5. Artist & Track Analysis:
- Found the top 10 rock bands by track count.
- Analyzed track durations to find songs longer than the average length.
## Tools Used:
- PostgreSQL: All queries and analyses were performed using PostgreSQL.
## Future Improvements:
- Expand analysis to cover additional genres and regions.
- Implement visualization tools for better data representation.
